# MirrorStream
Mirror an OSX Display to H264 video stream over IP

Simple screen capture, ffmpeg for H264 encoding etc.  I'm sure there are proper APIs to do hardware encoding and lots of other cool stuff in OSX - but frankly I'm more interested in getting to grips with Swift, and mixing Swift + C/C++ right now.
